A 3js and Blender based room portfolio.
Using the singleton approach from Andrew Woan's tutorial. 
Planning to use the base structure but make it an interactive environment instead of just another room portfolio.
Will (might) be used to also showcase my Blender projects whilst learning interactive 3D web design (There goes your memory)

You can use 'npm run dev' from the Main Folder named ThreeJSCharm (Third attempt, hopefully a charm) to view the website as it isn't hosted anywhere yet.
